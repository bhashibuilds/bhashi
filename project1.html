  <!-- Narrative -->
  <section class="narrative">
    <h2>Setting the Scene</h2>
    <p>
      Adhera was designed to bridge the gap between weight loss patients and clinics.
      While apps like MyFitnessPal or Noom focus on individual tracking, Adhera’s strength lies in its
      clinic-backed approach that empowers doctors with real-time patient analytics while helping patients stay consistent.
      I got the idea for this application while talking to my dad, who is a manager at a weight loss clinic, how treatment
      times are prolonged, or how many patients relapse after finding success for a short time. A lot of this
      is due to what happens outside of the clinic: nutrition and daily activity. Allowing these metrics to be shared with healthcare
      professionals for monitoring, and the ability to easily document your activities, and motivational reminders will allow patients to
      stay in track to their journey of health wellness.

  <section class="solution">
    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>
      Adhera is designed as a connected ecosystem that bridges the gap between patient self-tracking 
    and professional clinical oversight. Unlike consumer apps that focus solely on individuals, 
    Adhera’s strength lies in its dual approach: empowering patients with easy-to-use tools while 
    giving clinics real-time analytics that enhance care without adding extra workload.

  <h3>Calorie Tracking</h3>
  <p>
    Patients can log meals quickly by snapping a photo. Adhera’s AI then estimates calories, 
    portion sizes, and nutritional values. For greater accuracy, users can make manual adjustments 
    or log meals traditionally. This flexible approach reduces the friction of daily logging, 
    helping patients remain consistent over time.
  </p>

  <h3>Reminders</h3>
  <p>
    Unlike generic push notifications, Adhera provides smart, context-aware reminders. 
    These nudges adapt to a patient’s behavior whether it’s logging meals, drinking water, 
    or reviewing progress ensuring adherence feels supportive rather than intrusive. There will also
    be reminders for visiting the clinic, exercise, or to stay under the caloric limit for the day. 
  </p>

  <h3>Logging</h3>
  <p>
    Patients gain access to clean visualizations as they build profile over time. 
    These will visualize progress through trends and summaries.
  </p>

  <h3>Analytics</h3>
  <p>
    For clinics, Adhera transforms raw data into actionable insights. Real-time analytics 
    reveal patterns such as skipped logging, sudden calorie spikes, or steady improvements. 
    These insights allow doctors to intervene at the right moment, creating more personalized 
    and effective care plans. Clinic dashboards present adherence scores 
    and highlight at-risk patients, allowing providers to monitor multiple patients at a glance 
    without adding administrative burden.

<section class="research-stats">
  <h2>Key Research Statistics</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>About 50% of patients with chronic conditions do not adhere to treatment plans (WHO, 2003).</li>
    <li>The global digital health market is projected to reach $650B by 2025 (Statista, 2023).</li>
    <li>Mobile health apps can improve treatment adherence by 30–60% (Journal of Medical Internet Research, 2020).</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="market-need">
  <h2>Market & Business Opportunities</h2>
  <p>The global weight management market is valued at over $200B. Clinics seek digital tools that improve patient adherence and retention, while patients want sustainable, real-time guidance outside the clinic.</p><br>
 <p>Clinics benefit from higher patient retention, patients from improved outcomes, and insurers from reduced healthcare costs. The SaaS model allows scalability through subscriptions and licensing.</p>

  <!-- Reflection -->
  <section class="reflection">
    <h2>Reflection & Next Steps</h2>
    <p>
      Adhera taught me the importance of designing for both patients and clinics. Unlike consumer apps,
      the value here lies in the relationship it strengthens. My biggest takeaway: data-driven engagement
      can empower healthier outcomes when integrated seamlessly into existing workflows.
    </p>
    <p>Next steps include integration with wearable devices, AI-driven personalized diet plans, multilingual support, and partnerships with wellness programs and insurance providers.</p>
