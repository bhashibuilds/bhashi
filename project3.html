  <!-- Narrative -->
  <section class="narrative">
    <h2>Setting the Scene</h2>
    <p>
      Pre-medical students often struggle to find reliable guidance on their journey to medical school and beyond.
      While LinkedIn offers professional networking, it lacks the intimacy and structure that true mentorship requires.
      This project reimagines mentorship as a dedicated, role-based platform where aspiring doctors connect with 
      medical students, residents, and physicians who share their experiences and knowledge. 
      By creating a tailored ecosystem, the platform aims to make mentorship more accessible, impactful, and sustainable.
    </p>
    <blockquote>“Mentorship plays a critical role in shaping the careers of future physicians, yet 
    <u>access remains uneven</u>, especially for students from underrepresented or disadvantaged backgrounds.” — Academic Medicine Journal</blockquote>

  <!-- Problem -->
  <section class="problem-statement">
   <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>
  Connections and networking are extremely important in every industry, but they are especially critical in medicine, 
  where there are significant barriers for minorities to enter. Networking is essential.
</p>
<p>
  Pre-medical students lack structured, accessible mentorship opportunities, while mentors often lack a streamlined 
  way to connect, schedule, and track mentee progress.

  <!-- Solution -->
  <section class="solution">
    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>
      The mentorship platform provides a dedicated space for connecting mentors and mentees. 
      With role-based accounts, rich profiles, smart matching, and integrated messaging, 
      the platform makes mentorship more structured and meaningful. 
      Progress tracking and scheduling tools help ensure consistent growth for mentees 
      and a rewarding experience for mentors.
    </p>

    <h3>Role Based Accounts</h3>
    <p>Separate onboarding flows ensure mentors and mentees see features tailored to their needs from the start.</p>

    <h3>Rich Profiles</h3>
    <p>Profiles showcase education, specialties, career interests, and personal goals making it easier to find the right match.</p>

    <h3>Smart Matching</h3>
    <p>AI driven matching connects mentees with mentors who align in specialty, background, and career aspirations.</p>

    <h3>Messaging System</h3>
    <p>A secure, in app messaging system supports direct communication, with options to share resources and schedule meetings.</p>

    <h3>Mentorship Logs</h3>
    <p>Logs allow both parties to document meetings, goals, and progress—ensuring accountability and clarity over time.</p>

    <h3>Scheduling & Availability (Future Feature)</h3>
    <p>A calendar system will allow mentors to share their availability, making mentorship easy to plan and commit to.</p>

  <section class="research-stats">
    <h2>Key Research Statistics</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Mentorship has been shown to increase medical school acceptance rates by up to 25% (AAMC, 2021).</li>
      <li>Underrepresented students are 2x more likely to persist in medicine with consistent mentorship (JAMA, 2020).</li>
      <li>Digital mentorship platforms improve accessibility and engagement across socioeconomic barriers (MedEdPublish, 2022).</li>

  <!-- Market -->
  <section class="market-need">
    <h2>Market & Business Opportunities</h2>
    <p>
      With over 50,000 pre-medical applicants each year in the U.S. alone, the need for structured mentorship is growing rapidly. 
      The platform supports scalability via institutional partnerships, subscriptions, and integration with pre-med programs.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Benefits extend across stakeholders: mentees gain clarity and confidence, mentors build leadership skills, 
      and institutions improve student outcomes and retention.

  <!-- Reflection -->
  <section class="reflection">
    <h2>Reflection & Next Steps</h2>
    <p>
      This project highlighted the value of mentorship in shaping future medical professionals. 
      Unlike general networking platforms, the strength lies in its tailored design for structured guidance. 
      My key takeaway: mentorship is most effective when supported by tools that make the relationship easy to start, maintain, and grow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next steps include integrating scheduling, video chat support, multilingual features, and partnerships with medical schools 
      and nonprofit organizations to scale impact globally.
