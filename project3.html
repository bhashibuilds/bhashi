  <!-- Narrative -->
  <section class="narrative">
    <h2>Setting the Scene</h2>
    <p>
      First-generation and underrepresented students often struggle to access the mentorship and guidance they need to enter medicine. 
      Medtora was created to bridge this gap—using AI and community-driven features to make mentorship structured, accessible, 
      and personalized. The app reimagines mentorship by combining chat, scheduling, and AI support into a single platform. 
    </p>
    <blockquote>“Mentorship doubles persistence in medicine for underrepresented groups, yet <u>access is still limited</u>.” — JAMA, 2020</blockquote>

  <!-- Problem -->
  <section class="problem-statement">
   <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
   <p>
     Breaking into medicine is especially challenging for minorities, first-generation, and immigrant students who lack 
     built-in networks. At the same time, mentors want to give back but often don’t have streamlined ways to connect, 
     track progress, and guide students effectively.

  <section class="reflection">
    <h2>Reflection & Next Steps</h2>
    <p>
      Medtora showed me that mentorship works best when AI and human connection support each other. 
      Even a lightweight demo connected users, proving the potential for real-world impact. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Next steps include adding scheduling, video calls, and expanding through institutional partnerships 
      to scale mentorship opportunities for underrepresented students in medicine worldwide.
