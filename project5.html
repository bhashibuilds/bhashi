  <!-- Problem Definition -->
  <section class="narrative">
    <h2>Problem Definition</h2>
    <p>
       <p>
    The journey of NeuroLark began with a personal experience: my grandmother was in the final stages of dementia, 
    becoming almost childlike and needing constant assistance to perform basic tasks. This is the story of approximately 7 million americans.
    Patients struggle with memory lapses, medication adherence, and maintaining independence, while caregivers and 
    providers lack real-time monitoring solutions. Current tools are insufficient, creating an opportunity for a 
    dementia-focused AI voice assistant that supports memory, routine, and safety.

  <h2>From Discovery to Delivery</h2>
 <p>
    Initial Research: I began exploring dementia care challenges, reviewing existing memory aids, digital assistants, 
    and caregiving solutions. I identified gaps in solutions that work offline, provide personalized support, and 
    integrate both patient needs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Problem Recognition: There is a clear need for a memory support system that not only reminds patients but also 
    empowers caregivers with actionable insights, helping patients live more independently at home.

    <h2>Product</h2>
    <p>
      NeuroLark is a conceptual voice-first assistant designed to preserve dignity and independence for dementia patients. 
      Core MVP features include offline voice recognition, personalized memory bank, medication management, emergency support, and routine guidance.
    </p>
    <img src="neurolark2.png" alt="PRD diagram" class="case-image" />

<section class="how-it-works">
  <h3>How It Works</h3>
  <p>
    NeuroLark is an AI-powered voice assistant that continuously listens to the patient throughout the day. 
    It leverages information provided by the patient or their relatives about the patient’s past, routines, 
    and preferences before cognitive decline begins. Using this information alongside real-time activity data, 
    NeuroLark assists patients with memory and daily tasks, helping them maintain independence.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the patient encounters a situation requiring memory support—such as forgetting their birthday, address, 
    or an important appointment—the voice assistant activates automatically and provides the answer securely 
    through an earpiece. The earpiece is biometrically linked to the patient to ensure privacy and safety.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to reactive support, NeuroLark delivers timely reminders for medications, routines, and other 
    daily activities necessary for patient well-being. The system operates across multiple devices, creating 
    a “hive mind” that shares the same knowledge base, ensuring consistent assistance regardless of the device used.
  </p>
</section>


<section class="technical">
  <h2>Technical Requirements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Offline AI model (~2GB), works without internet</li>
    <li>HIPAA-compliant local data encryption</li>
    <li>iOS/Android apps and smart speaker compatibility</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Feasibility</h3>
  <p>
    NeuroLark is technically achievable using compact offline AI models 
    (e.g., Whisper for speech + LLaMA/Mistral for reasoning) that can run locally 
    on modern smartphones and smart speakers. Always-on voice listening is enabled 
    with wake-word detection and efficient transcription. Relatives can preload key 
    patient history (birthdays, addresses, medications), which is stored securely 
    and accessed for reminders or queries. Biometric earpieces ensure only the 
    patient receives private outputs. Data can sync across devices using encrypted 
    local cloud, creating a consistent "hive-mind" experience.
  </p>

  <h3>Challenges</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Battery & Processing: Running AI continuously requires optimization to avoid battery drain.</li>
    <li>Contextual Recall: Ensuring long-term memory accuracy is technically complex.</li>
    <li>Privacy & Safety: Continuous listening demands strict safeguards, HIPAA compliance, and transparent controls.</li>
    <li>Medical Liability: Errors in reminders or instructions could pose health risks and require regulatory approval.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Opportunities</h3>
  <p>
    Dementia care is a growing need worldwide. Current solutions like Alexa or 
    Google Assistant lack medical tailoring and privacy safeguards. NeuroLark bridges 
    healthcare and empathy with technology, offering peace of mind to families and 
    independence to patients. The system could expand into smart homes, wearables, 
    and healthcare networks for broader impact.
  </p>

  <h3>MVP Roadmap</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Preloaded memory database (input from relatives before decline)</li>
    <li>Offline voice assistant with wake-word + speech recognition</li>
    <li>Secure biometric earpiece delivering private answers and reminders</li>
    <li>Future: Encrypted multi-device sync ("hive-mind" system)</li>
  </ol>

  <!-- User Flows -->

    <h2>User Flows & Wireframes</h2>
    <p>Key flows include medication reminders and memory queries. Wireframes illustrate caregiver dashboard, setup flow, and patient interactions.</p>
    <img src="neurolark3.jpg" alt="Medication reminder flow" class="case-image" />

      <h3>Scenario 1: Medication Reminder Flow</h3>
  <p>
     Margaret receives a voice reminder: "It's time for your 9 AM medication." <br>
    She confirms via voice, and NeuroLark logs the adherence. <br>
   The system repeats the reminder twice and notifies caregiver if no response.
  </p>
    <img src="Neurolark5.png" alt="Memory query flow" class="case-image" />

  <!-- Memory Query Flow -->
  <h3>Scenario 2: Memory Query Flow</h3>
  <p>
    Margaret looks at a family photo and asks, "Who is this person?" 
    NeuroLark uses photo recognition and the memory bank to respond: "That's your daughter Sarah. She visited last Sunday and brought flowers." 
    Additional context or stories can be provided for emotional reinforcement.

  <!-- Competitive Analysis -->
  <section class="research-stats">
  <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
  <p>
    NeuroLark differentiates itself with dementia-specific AI, offline-first functionality, a voice-only interface, and real-time caregiver integration.
  </p>
  <h3>Direct Competitors</h3>
<p>GrandPad Tablet: Senior-friendly interface, family connection; limited AI, requires screen interaction.</p>
<p>CarePredict Wearable: Health monitoring, fall detection; no voice AI, expensive.</p>
<p>Claris Companion: 24/7 monitoring, professional caregivers; human-based, not AI, high cost.</p>

<h3>Indirect Competitors</h3>

<p>Amazon Alexa: Voice interaction and reminders; not dementia-specific, requires internet.</p>
<p>WHOOP (acquired tech): Wearable AI for health monitoring; could overlap with NeuroLark’s health insights.</p>
<p>Apple Health: Medication reminders; no voice AI, not dementia-focused.</p>
<p>Life Alert: Emergency response; no daily support or personalization.</p>
