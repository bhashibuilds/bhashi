  <p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; text-align: justify; color: #333;">
    Born in Chennai, India and raised between cultures, I moved to the United States at the age 
    of eight as a first-generation immigrant. Curious and a little mischievous as a child,
    I often took things apart and destroyed any complex gadget just to see how they worked, a habit that has grown into a
    love for exploring, questioning, and building. During high school, I pursued dual
    enrollment at PGCC in health sciences. Witnessing my grandmother’s cancer diagnosis initially drew me 
    toward medicine, and many of my tech projects reflect a strong medical influence
    and a desire to create tools that truly help people. Yet, through this journey,
    I realized that my curiosity and drive were not limited to medicine alone — I was
    passionate about solving problems at their root. I came to understand that leveraging technology would allow me to make a much broader impact than pursuing medicine alone.
    I discovered that technology could amplify my curiosity and impact, allowing me to
    build tools that touch more lives and tackle a wide variety of challenges. <br><br>
    I enjoy learning languages, from Chinese and French to Spanish, Hindi, Telugu, and Tamil. <a href="creative.html">I paint, draw, sculpt, and garden.</a> Whether through art,
    technology, or connection, I am always searching for new ways to build, understand, and give back to my community.
